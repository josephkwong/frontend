Techniques to make website responsive
-------------------------------------
1. Set the viewpoint at the page level
<meta name="viewpoint" content="width=device-width, initial-scaled=1.0">

2. Always use max-width/max-height

3. Use CSS Media Queries,
if my device is this than apply that style
if my device is between width 600 - 700 this than apply that style

4. Use units like rem/vh/vw instead of pixels
